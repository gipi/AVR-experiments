This repository will contain projects AVR related.

Each project is contained in a directory of its own and in order to
compile it you can

 $ cd <project name>
 $ make upload

It's possible to install the dependencies using the
following command in a Debian-like sistem

 # apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc

In the libraries/ directory are contained some routines very useful
to AVR projects. Are intended to be incluede in your source code
and not linked since it's very likely that the F_CPU or MCU values are
different from what you expect at compile time.
