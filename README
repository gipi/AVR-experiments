This repository will contain projects AVR related.

Each project is contained in a directory of its own and in order to
compile it you can

 $ cd <project name>
 $ make -f ../Makefile upload

There are two Makefile since I'm using either bus pirate and Arduino
as ISP programmer.

Since we are using the Arduino core build system it's mandatory
to install the appropriate package: in a Debian-like system as
superuser execute the following command

 # apt-get install arduino-mk
